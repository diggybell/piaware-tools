PHP Utilities to Analyze PiAware ADS-B Data

![image info](./docs/piaware-tools-splash.png)

## Introduction
These tools were created to analyze aircraft history data produced by
the PiAware ADS-B feeder. This page will describe the installation and operation of the tools.

As of 2025-05-18 the core platform is running stable. I am processing 2,000+ aircraft a day from my PiAware receiver. These are
a combination of airline, corporate, lease/charter, private, and military aircraft. I have my dashboard available on a public web
site at [PiAware Tools Dashboard](https://piaware-tools.diggybell.com).

## Are You Running PiAware Tools?
If you are running PiAware tools for your receiver I would be interested to hear from you. Visit the Discussion page and let me know
how it is going.

## Installation
Detailed instructions for installation and operation are available in the Wiki at [GitHub](https://github.com/diggybell/piaware-tools/wiki)
