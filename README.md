PHP Utilities to Analyze PiAware ADS-B Data

## Introduction
These tools were created to analyze aircraft history data produced by
the PiAware ADS-B feeder. This page will describe the installation and operation of the tools.

This is an early stage work in progress. There may be breaking changes in the future but I will do my best to keep those to a minimum.

## Installation
Detailed instructions for installation and operation are available in the Wiki at [GitHub](https://github.com/diggybell/piaware-tools/wiki)
